# Analyzing the Relevance of SOA Patterns for Microservice-Based Systems

This repository contains data used in a qualitative analysis of 118 SOA patterns from Erl ("SOA Design Patterns", "SOA with REST") and Rotem-Gal-Oz ("SOA Patterns"). The patterns were compared with 5 Microservices principles and rated either **fully applicable**, **partially applicable**, or **not applicable**.

The data and analysis can be found in [soa-pattern-analysis.xlsx](soa-pattern-analysis.xlsx).

The results are discussed in more details in the following publication:
